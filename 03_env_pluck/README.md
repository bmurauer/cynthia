# 03: Envelope Generator with VCA - MAILMAN 

Provides two envelope generators, the first of which also controls a VCA.
I build this because i always have at least one envelope generator controlling my vca, so i wanted to save some space by having one VCA built-in.

This one is a bit of a hack, it combines a rail-to-rail LM224 opamp for the env generator with a TL072 for the built-in VCA.
